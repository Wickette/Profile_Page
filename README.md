# Profile_Page

Attempt at my initial Portfolio Page to be worked on and added to as I acquire more knowledge in the BootCamp course

Had a lot of late nights, re-doing this over and over as my perfectionism was getting the best of me 

Could not figure out why the profile pic "avatar picture for now" was not showing the full picture (it gets cut of near the buttom unless in a small screen mode, but ran out of time to play around with it more)
